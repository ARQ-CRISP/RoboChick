# RoboChick
   All information needed to recreate RoboChick.

  RoboChick is an interactive robot capable of detecting and responding to chick behaviors. It was developed at Queen Mary University of London in order to provide a platform for identifying features that promote social interaction and filial imprinting in chicks. This repository contains all information needed to manufacture the basic version of RoboChick- with its simple, modular design, it can be easily customised depending on the requirements of the experiment.
